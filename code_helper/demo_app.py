            analysis = f"""**What this code actually does:**

**The `fibonacci(n)` function:**
This function calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. When you call `fibonacci(5)`, it breaks the problem down by calling `fibonacci(4) + fibonacci(3)`, which in turn call smaller versions of themselves. The base cases (n=0 returns 0, n=1 returns 1) stop the recursion. This creates a tree of function calls that eventually resolves to the correct Fibonacci number.

**The test loop at the bottom:**
This loop calls the fibonacci function for numbers 0 through 9 and prints each result. It's demonstrating how the function works by showing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.

**How the recursion works:**
When you call `fibonacci(4)`, it doesn't calculate the answer directly. Instead, it says "I need fibonacci(3) plus fibonacci(2)". Each of those calls breaks down further until you reach the base cases. The function calls stack up and then resolve backwards to give you the final answer."""

        elif "sort" in code.lower() or "bubble" in code.lower():
            analysis = f"""**What this code actually does:**

**The `bubbleSort(arr)` function:**
This function takes an unsorted array and returns it sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the array, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they're in the wrong order. The name "bubble sort" comes from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the beginning of the array.

**The optimization with the `swapped` flag:**
The code includes a smart optimization - if it goes through an entire pass without swapping any elements, it knows the array is already sorted and breaks out early. This makes the algorithm more efficient for arrays that are already partially sorted.

**The nested loop structure:**
The outer loop controls how many passes through the array we make, while the inner loop does the actual comparing and swapping. Each pass guarantees that the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position at the end.

**The test code at the bottom:**
This creates a test array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`, shows the original array, then calls bubbleSort on a copy and displays the sorted result. It demonstrates the function working on real data."""

        elif "class" in code.lower() and "account" in code.lower():
            analysis = f"""**What this code actually does:**

**The `BankAccount` class:**
This class creates a digital representation of a bank account. When you create a new BankAccount object, it stores the account holder's name, keeps track of the current balance, and maintains a history of all transactions.

**The `__init__` constructor:**
This sets up a new bank account when you create one. It takes the account holder's name and an optional starting balance (defaults to $0 if not provided). It also creates an empty list to track all transactions.

**The `deposit(amount)` method:**
This method adds money to the account. It first checks that you're depositing a positive amount, then adds it to the balance and records the transaction in the history. It returns True if successful, False if you try to deposit a negative amount.

**The `withdraw(amount)` method:**
This method removes money from the account, but only if you have enough funds and the amount is positive. It prevents overdrafts by checking that the withdrawal amount doesn't exceed the current balance. Like deposit, it records the transaction and returns True/False based on success.

**The `get_balance()` method:**
This is a simple getter method that returns the current account balance.

**The usage example at the bottom:**
This demonstrates the class in action - creating an account for "John Doe" with $1000, depositing $500, withdrawing $200, and then displaying the final balance of $1300."""
